Steps to build and run this app:
1. Copy all the files in the repo in the same directory
2. Run ./weatherdatasimulatop.pl -h for help on how to run the application
3. Change directory to the directory containing all the files created in step 1
4. Run the weatheardatasimulator.pl with -p <NOOFRECORDS> option

Note:- The Application has been run and tested on Perl version 5.24. This version
already has all the pre-requisite libraries already installed in the core distribution
and hence running the app should be easy. Although the app should run on all versions 
of Perl if the pre-requisite libraries are installed.
